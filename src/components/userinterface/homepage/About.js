            <Typography>
              A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases
              (including carbon dioxide and methane) that are generated by our
              actions. The average carbon footprint for a person in the United
              States is 16 tons, one of the highest rates in the world. Globally,
              the average carbon footprint is closer to 4 tons. To have the best
              chance of avoiding a 2â„ƒ rise in global temperatures, the average
              global carbon footprint per year needs to drop to under 2 tons by
              2050. Lowering individual carbon footprints from 16 tons to 2 tons
              doesnâ€™t happen overnight! By making small changes to our actions,
              like eating less meat, taking fewer connecting flights, and line
              drying our clothes, we can start making a big difference.
